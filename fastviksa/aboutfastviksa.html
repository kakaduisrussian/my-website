    <pre>< Hello There! />
        My name is Victor and i study at 
        The National Vocational High School In Computer 
        Technology Systems (UKTC) in Pravec, Bulgaria.
        This is my first attempt at constructing 
        a website with HTML5 and CSS.
        It took me only 8 hours and, 
        a few Red Bulls from start to finnish.
        My favorite programming languages must be 
        HTML & CSS because they're very user friendly
        and very easy for the beginners to learn.
        I work at "Fast Studio Bulgaria" and there 
        I learned a little bit HTML
        and then i learned a little bit CSS by myself.
